# Contributing to RVC WebGUI Fork

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! Your help is greatly appreciated. Every little bit helps.

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the main project.

This document provides a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Before opening a new issue, please perform a search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template; the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

Please include:

- A clear and descriptive title for the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- What you expected to happen.
- What actually happened.
- Your environment details (OS, Python version, etc.).
- Any relevant logs or screenshots.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

When creating a feature request, please provide:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the proposed functionality.
- A step-by-step description of the proposed enhancement in as much detail as possible.
- An explanation of why this enhancement would be useful.

### Pull Requests

We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, please add tests.
- Issue that pull request!

All changes need to be approved by the project maintainers, so your PR may be put on hold. We appreciate your patience.
